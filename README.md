This is the task

The task, in a nutshell, is to take some age-specific death rates, use these to calculate both crude death rates and age-standardized death rates, and then communicate your working process as if you were reporting to your line manager. 

You should be able to complete this exercise in two hours or less. If you cannot complete the whole exercise within this time, please submit what you have managed to complete and let us know how far you have gotten.
### The exercise

Below is a table showing the age-specific death rates from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in both the United States and Uganda in 2019. The values are given as deaths per 100,000 people.

Your task is to write a Python script that calculates both the crude death rate and the age-standardized death rate for all ages in both the United States and Uganda for 2019.

Your answers should represent the whole population of each country, and the value should be given as deaths per 100,000 people, rounded to one decimal place. 


At the beginning of your Python script, write a short paragraph (<300 words) describing your process as if you were reporting to your line manager.**

This should cover the steps you have taken, any assumptions you have made, and a brief description of the reasons for the differences between the different calculated death rates. 

Comments in the main body of your code that aid understanding of what the code is doing are *not* included in the 300 words.

The three items in this section are the only ones you should need to complete the task, but you may use others to help aid your understanding of crude and age-standardized death rates.
