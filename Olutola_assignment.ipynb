    "To fulfil this goal, we will use a structured technique to determine both the crude and age-standardized death rates for COPD in the United States and Uganda in 2019. These rates, supplied per 100,000 persons, were divided into age groups. To compute the crude death rates, I added the age-specific death rates for each country, which represents the total COPD mortality across all age groups. For age-standardized mortality rates, I used the World Health Organization's World Standard Population, which allows for a fair comparison between the two countries by accounting for disparities in age distribution. Assumptions include treating the provided age-specific mortality rates as typical of the whole population and rounding the resultant rates to one decimal place for clarity. Disparities in computed death rates may occur due to differences in age structures, healthcare systems, or demographic characteristics between the United States and Uganda. The age-standardized rates are a more standardised measure that accounts for disparities in age distribution, providing a more complete picture of COPD mortality in both nations."
